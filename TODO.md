# TODO: Update Theme Toggle and Header for Video Background Compatibility

## Tasks
- [x] Update .btn class in global.css to have semi-transparent background with blur in light mode and white text for visibility
- [x] Update header h1 in Dashboard.jsx to use white text in light mode for visibility against the video background
- [x] Update ThemeToggle.jsx to apply btn-light class conditionally in light mode
- [x] Verify that other boxes (Pomodoro, etc.) already have matching semi-transparent backgrounds
